# fivetran-terraform

This repo has code to create multiple modern data stacks with the [Fivetran Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/fivetran/fivetran/latest), and separate them into dev, test, and prod deployments. These deployments can be separated by [repositories]() or [workspaces]()

There are 4 files used in different ways 

*main.tf* - A terraform module that will create a Fivetran connector
*outputs.tf* - Formats and generates output values from main.tf
*terraform.tfvars* - Contains value for each variable declared in variables.tf
*variables.tf* - Defines variables that are used in main.tf

After cloning this repo, terraform.tfvars the following lines will have to be edited, regardless of which option is used to separate deployments 

``` 
fivetran_api_key = "YOUR FIVETRAN API KEY"                  // Fivetran API key and secret can be found 
fivetran_api_secret = "YOUR FIVETRAN API SECRET"            // at https://fivetran.com/account/settings
fivetran_group_id = "YOUR FIVETRAN DESTINATION GROUP ID"    // Destination Group ID is at https://fivetran.com/dashboard/warehouse
stripe_key = "YOUR STRIPE KEY"                              // https://stripe.com/docs/keys , other connector types can be used
```
